# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [e/EMAIL]` can be used as `n/John Doe e/johnDoe@gmail.com` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can accept multiple values.<br>
  e.g. `delete‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `delete 1`, `delete 1 2 4`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## üì• Managing Contacts

<box type="info" seamless>

**Detecting Duplicate Persons:**<br>

* The app detects duplicate persons based on a case-insensitive comparison of their names only.
* E.g., `John Doe`, `john doe`, and `JOHN DOE` are all considered the same person.
* If an `add` or `edit` command results in a duplicate person, the command would be rejected with an error message.

</box>

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/RELATIONSHIP] [nn/NICKNAME] [b/BIRTHDAY] [no/NOTES] [img/IMAGE_PATH] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. <small>(This is the number shown next to each contact in the list.)<small>
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person‚Äôs tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

**Examples:**
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`   
    Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
</br>
</br>
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/`   
    Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<box type="tip" seamless> To <strong>remove</strong> any optional field (e.g., nickname or birthday), simply leave the value blank. 
</br>E.g., to remove a nickname: <code>edit 2 nn/</code> </box>

### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes the specified person(s) from the address book.

**Format:** `delete INDEX‚Ä¶‚Äã`

* Deletes the person(s) at the specified `INDEX` values.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶).
* Supports deleting multiple people at once (e.g., `delete 1 2 4`).

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1 3` deletes the 1st and 3rd persons in the results of the `find` command.


### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the family book.

**Format:**
- `list` - Sorted by insertion order
- `list s/asc` ‚Äî Sorted by closest upcoming birthday<br>
    <br>
  <img src="images/UpcomingBirthdays.png" alt="Ui" height="400px" width="550px"> <br>
    <br>
- `list s/desc` ‚Äî Sorted by farthest upcoming birthday <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/DistantBirthdays.png" alt="Ui" height="400px" width="550px"> <br>
    <br>
  
<box type="warning" seamless>
When you edit a person's birthday while viewing a birthday-sorted list (`list s/asc` or `list s/desc`), the order of people in the list will update automatically based on the new birthday information. This might cause the edited person to appear in a different position in the list. Use `list` to restore the original order (before sorting).
</box>

---

## üîç Searching
### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names match any of the given keywords. If no exact or partial matches are found, the app will automatically attempt a fuzzy search to suggest similar names.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* Performs an exact and partial match search first.
  If no results are found, a fuzzy search will suggest similar names instead.   
  E.g., `find Jon` can return names like `John`, `Jonathan`, or `Joni`.
* The search is case-insensitive.  
  E.g., `find hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter.  
  E.g. `find Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Prefix matching. `find Ber` will match `Bertha`, `Bernice`, `Bern` etc.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).  
  E.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

**Examples:**
* `find Jon` returns `John Doe`, `Jonathan Sim`, `Joni Tan`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`  
* `find Mich` returns `Mick`, `Mach` if there is no name
</br>

<box type="warning" seamless>
When you edit a person's name while in a filtered view (after using `find`), the person card may disappear from the current view if their new name no longer matches the search criteria. Use `list` to see all contacts again.
</box>

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Commands

### Undoing the last command : `undo`

Reverts the most recent supported command.

**Supported commands:** `add`, `edit`, `delete`  
Other commands like `find`, `list`, `clear`, and `help`, etc, cannot be undone.

**Format:**  `undo`

### Redoing the last undone command : `redo`

Re-applies the most recent command that was undone using `undo`.

üîÑ `redo` only works if you‚Äôve just called `undo`.  
If there's nothing to redo, the command will do nothing.

**Format:**  `redo`

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.
It's important to note that the `clear` command cannot be undone using `undo` - so be wary when using clear!

**Format:** `clear`

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a help window with guidance on using the app.

<img src="images/helpMessage.png" alt="Ui" height="400px" width="540px"> <br>
    <br>

**Format:** `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

**Format:** `exit`

### Navigating the Command History
The application keeps track of the past 100 commands you've previously entered, allowing you to easily recall and reuse them.

**Usage:**
* Press the `Up` arrow key to access previous commands in reverse chronological order.
* Press the `Down` arrow key to navigate forward through the command history.
* Command history includes both valid and invalid commands.
* When you reach the most recent command, pressing `Down` will clear the command box.

This feature is particularly useful when you need to repeat commands with minor modifications or when you want to correct a previously entered command.

### Saving the data

AddressBook and command history data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`, and command history is saved as `[JAR file location]/data/commandhistory.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing these data files.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data files make their format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. This applies to both files independently - an invalid addressbook.json will cause contact data to be cleared, while an invalid commandhistory.json will cause command history to be cleared. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the files before editing them.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data files only if you are confident that you can update them correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
