Your family tree is a tangled mess, and every gathering feels like an **oral exam** you didn’t prepare for. Who was that cousin again? And what was your aunt’s dog’s name?

**WhoAreYouAgain?** is the **hilariously practical family address book** that saves you from awkward stares and frantic name-guessing at reunions. Designed as a **desktop application**, it provides a GUI on top of the Command Line Interface (CLI), making it fast and efficient to use.

* If you are interested in using WhoAreYouAgain, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing WhoAreYouAgain, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
