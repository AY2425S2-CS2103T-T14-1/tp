## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.
1. Please do note that this explanation is **intentionally** simplified (i.e. no elaboration on `executeConfirmed`) for the ease of reading and reference. 

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* stores a `CommandHistory` object that stores the past commands of the user. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, command history data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `CommandHistoryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* provides read-only interfaces (`ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `ReadOnlyCommandHistory`) for controlled data access.
* is implemented by concrete classes `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonCommandHistoryStorage` which extend the abstract generic `JsonStorage<T, S extends JsonSerializable<T>>` for type-safe serialization.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Current\] Undo/Redo feature

#### Current Implementation

The current undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CommandTracker`. It tracks the `Undoable` commands i.e. commands that extend `Undoable` in the form of 2 separate stacks: `undoStack` and `redoStack`. 
Additionally, it supports these operations:

* `CommandTracker#getInstance` - Returns the singleton instance of ```CommandTracker```
* `CommandTracker#push` - Pushes a new `UndoableCommmand` onto the undo stack and clears the redo stack
* `CommandTracker#popUndo` - Pops and returns the most recent command from the undo stack
* `CommandTracker#getRedo` - Pops and returns the most recent command from the redo stack
* `CommandTracker#canUndo` - Returns true if there are commands to undo
* `CommandTracker#canRedo` - Returns true if there are commands to redo
* `CommandTracker#clear` - Clears both the undo and redo stacks

Step 1: Initial Application Launch

- State:
  - The application is launched.
  - The address book contains preloaded contacts.

-  Behaviour:
    - No undo or redo operations are available at this point since no changes have been made.

Step 2: Adding a Person

- Action:
  - The user executes the `add` command to add a new person.
  - ```add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com```

- State:
    - The address book now contains the new person, John Doe.

-  Behaviour:
    - The `add` command is executed and is reflected in the new address book state (with the newly added person). 
    - ```CommandTracker.getInstance().push()``` is called to push this command to the undo stack.
        - This is allowed because the ```AddCommand``` extends ```UndoableCommand```.
    - `undo` is now available, but `redo` is not (since no action has been undone yet).

Step 3: Deleting a Person

- Action:
    - The user executes the ```delete``` command to delete the previously added person.
    - ```delete <index>``` where `index` is the location John Doe is stored.

- State:
    - The address book now no longer contains John Doe.

- Behaviour:
    - The ```delete command``` is executed and is reflected in the new address book state (without the deleted person).
    - ```CommandTracker.getInstance().push()``` is called to push this command to the undo stack.
        - This is allowed because the ```DeleteCommand``` extends ```UndoableCommand```.
    - `undo` is still available to restore the deleted person, but `redo` is still not available since delete has not been undone yet.

Step 4: Undoing the DeleteCommand

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

- Action:
    - The user decides to undo the delete command using the ```undo``` command.

- State:
    - The address book is reverted to the state before the delete command, with John Doe restored.

- Behaviour:
  - The ```undo``` command is called.
  - ```CommandTracker.canUndo()``` is called to see if the command can be undone.
      - Since it can, ```CommandTracker.getInstance().popUndo()``` is called to pop the command from the undo stack.
      - Subsequently, this command is also pushed to the redo stack.
  - The ```DeleteCommand#redo``` method is invoked on the last ```delete``` command and restores the deleted person.
  - `undo` is still available (for the intial ```add``` command) and `redo` is available since delete has been undone.

Step 5: Redoing the DeleteCommand

<puml src="diagrams/RedoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="RedoSequenceDiagram" />

- Action:
    - The user decides to redo the delete command using the ```redo``` command.

- State:
    - The address book is reverted to the state after the delete command, with John Doe deleted.

- Behaviour:
    - The ```redo``` command is called.
    - ```CommandTracker.canRedo()``` is called to see if the command can be redone.
        - Since it can, ```CommandTracker.getInstance().popRedo()``` is called to pop the command from the redo stack.
    - The ```DeleteCommand#redo``` method is invoked on the last ```delete``` command and deletes the person again.
    - `undo` is still available (for the intial ```add``` command) and `redo` is no longer available since delete has been redone.

**Note:** At this point, the user should be able to notice that the `undo` and `redo` commands can be called in a circular manner i.e. ```undo -> redo -> undo -> ...``` 

#### Planned Extensions
1. Ensure undo / redo restore order in any state
   1. This applies to the states after list and find have been executed followed by an `UndoableCommand`
2. Implement undo / redo for `clear`

### \[Proposed\] Possible Undo/Redo Implementation
The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagramProposed-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Individuals with large extended families who struggle to keep track of relationships
* Users who frequently attend family gatherings and want to avoid awkward moments of forgetting names and relationships
* Individuals who want an organized way to store family details such as birthdays, nicknames, and notable events
* Users looking for an easy-to-use digital family directory
* Users who prefer typing to mouse interactions
* Users who are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

**WhoAreYouAgain?** is a family directory app designed to help users remember family members, track important dates,
and avoid social faux pas during family gatherings. It provides a structured way to manage extended family information,
ensuring that users never forget key relationships, birthdays, or inside jokes. The app simplifies family
record-keeping while adding a fun and practical element to family interactions.
